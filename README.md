## About

In [Slime Volleyball](https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym), a two-player competitive game, we investigate how <ins>modelling uncertainty</ins> improves AI playersâ€™ learning in 3 ways: <ins>1) against an expert</ins>, <ins>2) against itself</ins> and <ins>3) against each other</ins>, in the domain of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

We show that by modelling uncertainty, Bayesian methods improve MARL training in 5 ways: <ins>1) performance<ins>, </ins>2) sample efficiency</ins>, <ins>3) training stability</ins>, <ins>4) uncertainty</ins> and <ins>5) generalisability</ins>, and through experiments using TensorFlow Probability and Stable Baselines, we present interesting differences in agent behaviour.

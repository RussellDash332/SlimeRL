## Summary

In [Slime Volleyball](https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym), a two-player competitive game, we investigate how <ins>learning under uncertainty</ins> improves AI playersâ€™ learning in 3 ways in the domain of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL):

1. Against an expert
2. Against itself
3. Against each other

We show that <ins>by modelling uncertainty</ins>, Bayesian methods do improve MARL training performance, and through experiments using TensorFlow Probability and Stable Baselines, we present interesting differences in agent behaviour.
